</div>
<p class="ph3">BY AN EXAMINING OFFICER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a recently issued, readable little volume by
Mr W. D. Chester, H.M. Customs, London,
entitled <i>Chronicles of the Customs</i>, there occurs
a chapter on the tricks of smugglers, which
suggests an interesting comparison of past and
present methods of smuggling. The volume
referred to treats of many matters connected
with Customs’ work besides the prevention of
smuggling; but we must confine our remarks
to smuggling pure and simple, with a few
examples of clever evasions of the Customs’
laws.</p>

<p>From the days of Ethelred, when it was
enacted that ‘every smaller boat arriving at
Billingsgate should pay for toll or custom one
halfpenny, a larger boat with sails one penny,’
those who have had to carry out the collection
of the revenue have been disliked by
everybody who had to submit to taxation. It
is not easy to understand this dislike. People
who use coal, gas, water, or any of the necessities
of existence do not, as a rule, view with very
great disfavour the people whom they pay to
supply these commodities. Why they should
dislike those whose business it is to collect the
funds which provide government with the
wherewithal to insure protection for life, property,
and trade, is an anomaly which it is difficult
to comprehend. In olden days, the bold and
daring smuggler was the darling of the coast,
and the officers who endeavoured to prevent his
depredations the most disliked of all government
officials. Yellow-backed novels have portrayed
his prowess in the most glowing colours.
The word-pictures which represent him as a
free-and-easy, good-natured soul, with gentlemanly
manners and genteel exterior, have been
read and admired wherever English novels of a
seafaring type have been circulated; and no exciting
ocean tale is considered sufficiently spicy
unless a chapter or two is devoted to the daring
thief who defies his country’s laws, and is
rewarded with admiration for doing so; while
ordinary thieves are spoken of with contempt,
and obtain a far from acceptable recompense in
the shape of jail ‘skilly.’</p>

<p>No longer ago than 1883, an amusing case,
illustrative of this feeling, occurred in the neighbourhood
of Sunderland. A party of officers
had been away at Hull attending a departmental
examination. On their return journey in the
train, they met with a seafaring man, who, not
knowing the profession of his fellow-passengers,
entered into a long conversation on the comparatively
easy methods by which he—the
sailor—evaded detection. Growing eloquent on
this theme, he further explained the <i>modus
operandi</i> of his proceedings, and informed the
officers that he had in his chest an ingeniously
concealed receptacle for the very purpose of
smuggling, and that he then had in it several
pounds of foreign tobacco. Great was his consternation
to find, on his arrival at Sunderland,
that his fellow-passengers were Customs’ officers,
who at once seized the man’s chest and confiscated
the tobacco found therein, for the
possession of which the loquacious seaman was
subsequently fined. The moral of the story
rests in the fact, that no sooner was the affair
made known, than the local press went ablaze
with denunciations of the unfortunate officers
who had prevented the country’s pockets being
pilfered of the amount of duty leviable on the
quantity of tobacco found. The incident is one
which proves that among a certain class of
people the smuggler is a hero still. With the
audience in a police court the smuggler is no
end of a favourite. Only a few months ago,
a case occurred at Whitby where a couple of
fishermen were charged with smuggling about
forty-four pounds of tobacco, the highest penalty
for which being £42 with alternative imprisonment.
The Bench, however, let the prisoners
off with the mitigated fine of £30, and yet, on
the announcement of the merciful decision,
‘there were,’ says the police-court reporter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">{274}</span>
‘expressions of disapprobation in the crowded
court.’</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the sympathising feeling
which in the olden time and at the present
day was and is extended to the smuggler, it is
satisfactory to find that his nefarious transactions
do not always shield him from ridicule. Not
long ago, a friend of mine was crossing from
the continent to one of the eastern English
ports, and on the voyage was applied to by
another passenger as to how he—the passenger—could
most successfully evade paying the duty
on two or three boxes of cigars which he had
in his possession. My friend, who knew something
of Custom House strictness, and had,
besides, a conscientious respect for the laws of
his country, advised his fellow-voyager either to
throw the cigars overboard, or to ‘declare’ and
pay duty upon them when he landed. This,
it subsequently transpired, the passenger did
not do, but rolled up the cigars in some soiled
linen and placed the lot in a portmanteau.
When it came to declaring baggage at the
landing-stage or railway station, the smuggler,
like many of his class, grew timid, and left his
portmanteau in the hands of the Customs’
officials without owning it as his property.
My friend declares that the scared look of the
gentleman-smuggler as he hid back in the railway
carriage while a Customs’ boatman walked
up and down the platform with the unlucky
portmanteau, and calling out stentoriously,
‘Claim your luggage! claim your luggage!’
was a sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.
The unfortunate passenger of course lost his
portmanteau, clothes, and cigars.</p>

<p>In order to present to the reader the unromantic
aspect of present-day smuggling in a comparative
light, the writer is induced to quote one or two
cases mentioned by Mr Chester. By perusing
these selected instances, and comparing them
with the methods adopted in our own day, it
will be seen that smuggling in former times was
surrounded with an adventurous atmosphere
which certainly does not obtain in a matter-of-fact
age like the present. One of the cases
quoted by Mr Chester is a characteristic one.
It occurred at the time when duties were levied
on laces, silks, gloves, &amp;c. These were mostly
French manufactures, and, consequently, Dover
and other southern ports were the most convenient
localities in which the smuggling fraternity
exercised their calling. At that time, well-horsed
spring vans were used to convey the goods from
Dover to London, and at intervals on the journey,
particular houses were used as storage places for
the booty until it could be safely conveyed to the
metropolis. ‘On one occasion,’ says Mr Chester,
‘the Customs’ officers at Dover were sent on a
fool’s errand. A van loaded with silk and lace
left the town at night; and to insure it a successful
journey, an accomplice informed the officers
of its departure, the venture being suspected.
Forthwith they went in pursuit in a postchaise.
The parties in the van, after going about four
miles, drew into a side-road, extinguished the
lights, and remained quiet. The officers soon
rushed by in hot haste; and when they had passed,
the smugglers betook themselves in another direction,
and got safely off with their booty.’</p>

<p>At a time when goods were subjected to <i>ad
valorem</i> duties, there were no end of tricks practised
by which an importer, whose goods were
seized, obtained his own importations for the
veriest trifle, and thus made a handsome profit
by his cleverness. Mr Chester relates an instance
of an importer, more shrewd than honest, who
imported into Folkestone a case of gloves on
which he declined to pay duty. The goods, of
course, were seized. Into London, the same
gentleman imported a similar case with a like
result. When the goods were offered for sale at
the two places, it was found that the Folkestone
case contained all right-hand gloves, while those
in London were all left-hand gloves. Being
considered valueless, they were knocked down
to the buyer for a mere trifle. It is needless to
add that the buyer in each case was the importer,
who paired the gloves and pocketed a respectable
profit by the transaction.</p>

<p>Another instance from the same authority
illustrates the stratagems which were resorted
to for the purpose of evading Customs’ duties on
watches, when such imports were in vogue. A
foreigner, it appears, had made up his mind to
realise a small fortune at the expense of his
comfort; so, taking a passage from Holland, he
secreted a large number of watches round his
body in leathern receptacles. The weight was
so great that the unfortunate smuggler was
unable to lie down. He had calculated on a
voyage of twenty-four hours, but, being a
foreigner, he little knew the density or the
stopping powers of a Thames fog. The fog
detained the ship for another twenty-four hours;
and when the vessel arrived in London, the strain
on the smuggler’s system had been so enormous
that he was completely exhausted; his courage
oozed out with his strength; and at last he
gave himself up to the Customs’ officials, who
had had a watchful eye on his suspiciously
distressed-looking features.</p>

<p>Since the so-called ‘good old days’ of the
novelist, smuggling has lost much of its attractiveness.
The abolition of duty on watches,
silks, lace, gloves, &amp;c., has done a great deal
to lessen an illicit traffic, and wholesale attempts
at smuggling are now of comparatively rare
occurrence. Of course, now and again a case
crops up in which the old spirit seems to
have revived; but such cases are comparatively
few. Yet, though petty smuggling is,
in the main, the special offence with which
Customs’ officers have now to deal, wholesale
smuggling has not yet become a thing
of the past. In 1881, a daring attempt to
defraud the revenue took place in London. The
writer happened to be stationed there at the
time, and can well remember the excitement
caused in official circles by the discovery, and can
recollect the crowds of officers who used daily
to visit the quayage front of the Custom House,
where lay a pair of marine boilers in which five
tons of tobacco had been conveyed to this country
from Rotterdam. The history of the attempted
fraud is an interesting one. An anonymous
writer, it appears, had been giving continuous
hints to the officials in London that extensive
smuggling was being carried on between Rotterdam
and England. Such anonymous communications
being far from uncommon in Lower
Thames Street, but little attention was paid to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">{275}</span>
them, till at last the writer grew so persistent in
his efforts, and gave such plausible and detailed
information, that a detective officer was sent to
Rotterdam to watch the ingenious proceedings.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the information given by
the informer, the officer occupied a room from
which a view of a large boiler-foundry was
obtainable. Keeping strict watch, he saw large
quantities of tobacco being packed, by means of
hydraulic pressure, into a couple of marine
boilers, which, when the packing was completed,
were placed on board a steamer for conveyance,
if I remember aright, to Newcastle. Unfortunately,
however, for the parties concerned in the
smuggling transaction, a telegram arrived before
the boilers. These were not seized at Newcastle,
but were allowed to be placed on the railway
and reach King’s Cross, London, without interference,
the authorities wishing to take the
principal participators red-handed. At King’s
Cross they duly arrived, and remained unclaimed
for several days. At last, one was taken to a
railway arch at Stepney, where it was watched
day and night until the smugglers came to claim
it, when they were of course arrested. The other
boiler, which had remained at King’s Cross, was—through
a telegraphic error, which caused the
police to relax their watchfulness—removed from
that locality without their knowledge. But the
conveyance on which it was removed broke down
under the heavy weight, and through this unlooked-for
casualty, it was at last secured. The
smugglers were mulcted in a fine of nearly five
thousand pounds, and being unable to pay it, were
sent to jail. The writer remembers well inspecting
the boilers when they were lying at the Custom
House, and to those who had the opportunity
of seeing them, their construction gave ample
evidence that smuggling as a science was not
yet entirely extinct. The boilers were simply
‘dummies.’ The iron used in their construction
was too thin to resist steam-pressure, and they
had evidently been made for the express purpose
of conveying tobacco to this country. It is
not at all improbable, either, that the ‘dummy’
boilers had made more than one trip to England,
and had put a good many pounds sterling in
the pockets of their ingenious but dishonest
designers.</p>

<p>Another famous instance of present-day smuggling
was brought to light in the Queen’s Bench
division in 1883. From the evidence then given,
it appeared that the smugglers had inaugurated
a systematic method of conveying tobacco from
Rotterdam, and that, by no means content with
the old-fashioned practice of having a single
buyer and seller, they had regularly appointed
agents, whom they stationed at different ports
in the United Kingdom. On the arrival of the
tobacco, the agent or agents communicated by
telegraph with the principals in the affair, and
by means of an arranged cipher, gave information
as to when the goods arrived and when
they had passed the Customs’ officers undetected.
The principal was an Irishman, who carried on
business as a tobacco merchant. He had a
brother who traded in flax-seed. It occurred to
the former that importations of tobacco which
had evaded the duty would be much more profitable
than duty-paid importations, and what
more natural than that his brother’s barrels of
flax-seed would form a not easily detected mode
of conveyance? The course adopted then was
this: a large quantity of flax-seed was purchased
at Rotterdam, and also a quantity of tobacco.
Sixty pounds-weight of the tobacco was rammed
firmly down into the bottom of a cask, which
was then filled up with flax-seed; and the casks
so filled were shipped to this country, and
reported and entered as containing flax-seed only.
On one occasion, four hundred casks containing
tobacco stowed in this way escaped detection;
and in April 1882, fourteen hundred pounds of
tobacco were smuggled into the country in
twenty-five casks, each containing half a hundredweight
of tobacco. Later on in the same month,
two thousand pounds of tobacco followed their
predecessors, and further consignments occurred
in May.</p>

<p>At last the crisis came. Somebody, in smuggling
parlance, ‘split;’ the officers boarded a ship
from Rotterdam, opened the casks, and the
nefarious consignment was at last laid bare.
Despite the discovery, the Attorney-general, who
conducted the case for the Crown, had no little
difficulty in bringing the guilt home to the proper
parties. The concealed tobacco had all been
addressed to fictitious consignees, but the evidence
of an accomplice exposed such a state of affairs
that the defendant consented to a verdict being
entered against him for over six thousand pounds,
being treble the value of the goods, of which
penalty, however, only one-third was eventually
enforced.</p>

<p>But this was by no means the end of the history
of one of the most daring attempts in the annals
of modern smuggling. Some few months later,
an action was brought against a tenant farmer in
Ireland to recover £1731, 12s. 6d., being treble
the value of nearly two thousand pounds of
tobacco found on his premises. The discovery,
as in most cases of the sort, was brought about
by information. A police constable, ‘from information
received,’ reported his suspicions to his
superiors. A search was then instituted among
the outhouses of the defendant’s premises. In
the first story of one of the outhouses were a
piggery and carthouse, the loft being reached
by a ladder. One of the constables mounted
the ladder, and peering through a chink in the
locked door, perceived a bag lying on the floor
with tobacco protruding from it. The door
having been forced, fourteen bags of tobacco
were found, with flax-seed scattered over them,
the latter naturally suggesting the quarter from
which the tobacco was obtained. The farmer
when questioned denied all knowledge of the
tobacco, asserting that he had let the loft at a
weekly rental to a man whom he did not know.
Evidence, however, was stronger than assertion.
It was proved that the farmer, subsequent to the
flax-seed seizure mentioned above, frequently
brought bags and bales of cake and leaf-tobacco
to the tobacco merchant’s premises about six
o’clock in the morning, and that it was spun
during the night. The jury were inclined to
think that the farmer was not so innocent as
he pretended to be, and found a verdict for the
Crown in the full amount claimed.</p>

<p>We have now, perhaps, given sufficient instances
of wholesale smuggling to warrant the
opinion that illicit traffic in dutiable articles is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">{276}</span>
not yet confined to the sailor or fireman who
ekes out a scanty wage by bringing a couple
or three pounds of tobacco or a few bottles of
spirits to dispose of at the end of a short continental
voyage. We will, then, before bringing
this paper to a conclusion, give a brief description
of the methods of concealment now pursued in
petty smuggling cases. One system, now happily
on the wane, is known as that of ‘Coopering,’ and
the method is as follows. For some years past, a
number of Dutch vessels had taken up positions
along the eastern coast just outside the ‘three-mile
limit.’ Their object was to provide tobacco,
spirits, and even obscene pictures to the fishermen
who frequent the locality. The tobacco was of
the vilest description; and the fiery, so-called
brandy viler still. The fishermen, thinking that
the Customs’ officers did not suspect, grew bold
in their transactions, and bought tobacco and
spirits right and left from the Dutch ‘Coopers.’
Suspicion was aroused, however, and a raid was
made on the fishing-boats. Only a small quantity
of dutiable articles was discovered; but, as it
subsequently transpired that a fishing coble
had slipped off to give warning of the raid to
the vessels that were still coming in, and that
suspicious parcels and stone bottles of foreign
manufacture were thrown by many of these craft
into the sea in full view of the people on the
shore, the quantity discovered was by no means
a criterion of the extent of the illicit traffic.
It has been calculated that during the fishing
season five hundred pounds of smuggled tobacco
per week were consumed by the fishing population
of a small port on the eastern coast, and that in
a seaport fishing-town in the same district, of
from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand inhabitants,
the revenue was defrauded to the extent
of from four thousand to five thousand pounds
per annum.</p>

<p>The smuggler’s present methods of concealment,
notwithstanding frequent detections, give evidence
that if not so inventive as his more courageous
predecessors, he still retains their faculty of
hiding his contraband goods in places where
they will probably be least suspected. A case
occurred at Hull, in December 1883, which
proves that perseverance at least is still an
attribute possessed by the smuggler. On the
arrival of a steamer at that port, the officers
discovered in the donkey-engine boiler twenty-one
pounds of tobacco. To effect the seizure,
the officers were compelled to unscrew the manhole
lid of the boiler; and on a consulting
engineer being called to give evidence, he stated
that it must have taken at least a couple of
hours to stow the tobacco away. Another
case of a similar nature occurred at Sunderland
some time ago, when an engineer on
board a steamer had a large tin made exactly to
fit the manhole of a water-tank. The water-tight
tin was packed with tobacco and sunk in
the tank, so that the smuggler had to strip to
get at it. With amusing candour, the prisoner
explained, when brought before the magistrates,
that ‘of course it was no use putting the can
where the officers would easily find it.’ False-bottomed
drawers and chests were formerly a
favourite hiding-place for contraband goods; but
the trick is now too well known to be safe.</p>

<p>Another method much in vogue in the old
days of smuggling, but seldom practised now,
was to conceal tobacco in loaves of bread specially
baked for the purpose. This particular
trick has not been lost sight of altogether. At
Hull, in March 1884, on a Customs’ officer
rummaging the firemen’s quarters on board a
steamer, he found two loaves of bread baked
in the German fashion. Taking them in his
hand, he suspected the weight as being excessive,
and cutting one in two with his knife, found
four pounds of tobacco inside. The packages
had been firmly tied together, and a thin crust
baked over them.</p>

<p>An ingenious place of concealment was discovered
by the officers at Hull in January 1883,
when, on boarding a vessel from the continent,
they found seventeen boxes of cigars concealed
in the hollow of the port and starboard rails
which surmounted the bulwarks. Underneath
firewood, buried in ballast, hidden in chain
lockers, beneath oilcloths, in the stuffing of sofa-pillows,
behind cabin panels, in the empty
interior of an innocent-looking cabin clock, in
these and a thousand other places have the
officers, from time to time, discovered the contraband
of the smuggler; while it is known that the
ropes apparently constituting the upper rigging
of small craft have occasionally consisted of
tobacco twisted into a resemblance of cordage!</p>

<p>From what we have written, it would appear
that though smuggling on an extensive scale
belongs more to past than to present days,
yet the same spirit still exists among people,
otherwise honest enough, whose education and
social position ought to free them from thieving
propensities. It is almost against human
nature to expect that revenue frauds will ever
be thoroughly eradicated while the present
high duties on special commodities are maintained.
The duty on tobacco, for instance,
amounting to five times its value, makes it one
of the greatest temptations to seamen. Most
strenuous efforts on the part of the Customs’
authorities and shipowners have been made to
eradicate the traffic, yet every now and then a
successful detection—which represents three or
four successful evasions—occurs, which shows that
the spirit of smuggling is difficult to conquer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> governor’s dance was the great event of the
Trinidad season—the occasion to which every
girl in the whole island looked forward for
months with the intensest interest. And it was
also a great event to Dr Whitaker; for it was
the one time and place, except the Hawthorns’
drawing-room, where he could now meet Nora
Dupuy on momentary terms of seeming equality.
In the eye of the law, even in Trinidad, white
men, black men, and brown men are all equal;
and under the governor’s roof, as became the
representative of law and order in the little
island, there were no invidious distinctions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">{277}</span>
persons between European and negro. Every
well-to-do inhabitant, irrespective of cuticular
peculiarities, was duly bidden to the governor’s
table: ebony and ivory mingled freely together
once in a moon at the governor’s At Homes
and dances. And Dr Whitaker had made up his
mind that on that one solitary possible occasion
he would venture on his sole despairing appeal
to Nora Dupuy, and stand or fall by her final
answer.</p>

<p>It was not without serious misgivings that
the mulatto doctor had at last decided upon
thus tempting Providence. He was weary of
the terrible disillusion that had come upon him
on his return to the home of his fathers; weary
of the painfully vulgar and narrow world into
which he had been cast by unrelenting circumstances.
He could not live any longer in Trinidad.
Let him fight it out as he would for the sake
of his youthful ideals, the battle had clearly
gone against him, and there was nothing left
for him now but to give it up in despair and
fly to England. He had talked the matter over
with Edward Hawthorn—not, indeed, the question
of proposing to Nora Dupuy, for that he
held too sacred for any other ear, but the
question of remaining in the island and fighting
down the unconquerable prejudice—and even
Edward had counselled him to go; for he felt
how vastly different were the circumstances of
the struggle in his own case and in those of
the poor young mulatto doctor. He himself
had only to fight against the social prejudices
of men his real inferiors in intellect and culture
and moral standing. Dr Whitaker had to face
as well the utterly uncongenial brown society
into which he had been rudely pitchforked by
fate, like a gentleman into the midst of a pot-house
company. It was best for them all that
Dr Whitaker should take himself away to a
more fitting environment; and Edward had
himself warmly advised him to return once more
to free England.</p>

<p>The governor’s dance was given, not at Government
House in the Plains, but at Banana Garden,
the country bungalow, perched high up on a
solitary summit of the Westmoreland mountains.
The big ballroom was very crowded; and Nora
Dupuy, in a pale, maize-coloured evening dress,
was universally recognised by black, brown, and
white alike as the belle of the evening. She
danced almost every round with one partner
after another; and it was not till almost half
the evening had passed away that Dr Whitaker
got the desired chance of even addressing her.
The chance came at last just before the fifth
waltz, a dance that Nora had purposely left
vacant, in case she should happen to pick up
in the earlier part of the evening an exceptionally
agreeable and promising partner. She was sitting
down to rest for a moment beside her chaperon
of the night, on a bench placed just outside
the window in the tropical garden, when the
young mulatto, looking every inch a gentleman
in his evening dress—the first time Nora had
ever seen him so attired—strolled anxiously up
to her, with ill-affected carelessness, and bowed
a timid bow to his former travelling companion.
Pure opposition to Mr Dupuy, and affection
for the two Hawthorns, had made Nora exceptionally
gracious just that moment to all brown
people; and, on purpose to scandalise her ‘absurdly
punctilious’ chaperon, she returned the doctor’s
hesitating salute with a pleasant smile of perfect
cordiality. ‘Dr Whitaker!’ she cried, leaning
over towards him in a kindly way, which made
the poor mulatto’s heart flutter terribly; ‘so
here you are, as you promised! I’m so glad
you’ve come this evening.—And have you brought
Miss Whitaker with you?’</p>

<p>The mulatto hesitated and stammered. She
could not possibly have asked him a more <i>mal
à propos</i> question. The poor young man looked
about him feebly, and then answered in a low
voice: ‘Yes; my father and sister are here somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘Nora, my dear,’ her chaperon said in a tone
of subdued feminine thunder, ‘I didn’t know
you had the pleasure of Miss Whitaker’s acquaintance.’</p>

<p>‘Neither have I, Mrs Pereira; but perhaps
Dr Whitaker will be good enough to introduce
me.—Not now, thank you, Dr Whitaker; I don’t
want you to run away this minute and fetch
your sister. Some other time will do as well.
It’s so seldom, you know, we have the chance
of a good talk now, together.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker smiled and stammered. It was
possible, of course, to accept Nora’s reluctance
in either of two senses: she might be anxious
that he should stop and talk to her; or she
might merely wish indefinitely to postpone the
pleasure of making Miss Euphemia’s personal
acquaintance; but she flooded him so with the
light of her eyes as she spoke, that he chose
to put the most flattering of the two alternative
interpretations upon her ambiguous sentence.</p>

<p>‘You are very good to say so,’ he answered,
still timidly; and Nora noticed how very different
was his manner of speaking now from
the self-confident Dr Whitaker of the old <i>Severn</i>
days. Trinidad had clearly crushed all the confidence
as well as all the enthusiasm clean out of
him. ‘You are very good, indeed, Miss Dupuy;
I wish the opportunities for our meeting occurred
oftener.’</p>

<p>He stood talking beside her for a minute or
two longer, uttering the mere polite commonplaces
of ballroom conversation—the heat of the evening,
the shortcomings of the band, the beauty of the
flowers—when suddenly Nora gave a little jump
and seized her programme with singular discomposure.
Dr Whitaker looked up at once,
and divined by instinct the cause of her hasty
movement. Tom Dupuy, just fresh from the
cane-cutting, was looking about for her down
the long corridor at the opposite end of the
inner garden. ‘Where’s my cousin? Have you
seen my cousin?’ he was asking everybody; for
the seat where Nora was sitting with Mrs Pereira
stood under the shade of a big papaw tree, and
so it was impossible for him to discern her
face, though she could see his features quite
distinctly.</p>

<p>‘I won’t dance with that horrid man, my
cousin Tom!’ Nora said in her most decided
voice. ‘I’m quite sure he’s coming here this
minute on purpose to ask me.’</p>

<p>‘Is your programme full?’ Dr Whitaker inquired
with a palpitating heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">{278}</span></p>

<p>‘No; not quite,’ she answered, and handed it
to him encouragingly. There was just one dance
still left vacant—the next waltz. ‘I’m too tired
to dance it out,’ Nora cried pettishly. ‘The
horrid man! I hope he won’t see me.’</p>

<p>‘He’s coming this way, dear,’ Mrs Pereira put
in with placid composure. ‘You’ll have to sit
it out with him, now; there’s no help for
it.’</p>

<p>‘Sit it out with him!—sit it out with Tom
Dupuy! O no, Mrs Pereira; I wouldn’t do it
for a thousand guineas.’</p>

<p>‘What will you do, then?’ Dr Whitaker asked
tremulously, still holding the programme and
pencil in his undecided hand. Dare he—dare
he ask her to dance just once with him?</p>

<p>‘What shall I do?—Why, nothing simpler.
Have an engagement already, of course, Dr
Whitaker.’</p>

<p>She looked at him significantly. Tom Dupuy
was just coming up. If Dr Whitaker meant to
ask her, there was no time to be lost. His
knees gave way beneath him, but he faltered
out at last in some feeble fashion: ‘Then, Miss
Dupuy, may I—may I—may I have the pleasure?’</p>

<p>To Mrs Pereira’s immense dismay, Nora immediately
smiled and nodded. ‘I can’t dance it
with you,’ she said with a hasty gesture—she
shrank, naturally, from that open confession of
faith before the whole assembled company—‘but
if you’ll allow me, I’ll sit it out with you here
in the garden. You may put your name down
for it, if you like. Quickly, please—write it
quickly; here’s Tom Dupuy just coming.’</p>

<p>The mulatto had hardly scratched his own
name with shaky pencilled letters on the little
card, when Tom Dupuy swaggered up in his
awkward, loutish, confident manner, and with
a contemptuous nod of condescending half-recognition
to the overjoyed mulatto, asked, in his
insular West Indian drawl, whether Nora could
spare him a couple of dances.</p>

<p>‘Your canes seem to have delayed you too
late, Tom Dupuy,’ Nora answered coldly. ‘Dr
Whitaker has just asked me for my last vacancy.
You should come earlier to a dance, you know,
if you want to find a good partner.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy stared hard at her face in puzzled
astonishment. ‘Your last vacancy!’ he cried
incredulously. ‘Dr Whitaker! No more dances
to spare, Nora! No, no, I say; this won’t do,
you know! You’ve done this on purpose.—Let
me have a squint at your programme, will
you?’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t choose to take my word for the
facts,’ Nora answered haughtily, ‘you can see
the names and numbers of my engagements for
yourself on my programme.—Dr Whitaker, have
the kindness to hand my cousin my programme,
if you please.—Thank you.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy took the programme ungraciously,
and glanced down it with an angry eye. He
read every name out aloud till he came to number
eleven, ‘Dr Whitaker.’ As he reached that name,
his lip curled with an ugly suddenness, and
he handed the bit of cardboard back coldly to
his defiant cousin. ‘Very well, Miss Nora,’ he
answered with a sneer. ‘You’re quite at liberty,
of course, to choose your own company however
it pleases you. I see your programme’s quite
full; but your list of names is rather comprehensive
than select, I fancy.—The last name was
written down as I was coming towards you.
This is a plot to insult me.—Dr Whitaker, we
shall settle this little difference elsewhere, probably—with
the proper weapon—a horsewhip.
Though your ancestors, to be sure, were better
accustomed, I believe, sir, to a good raw cowhide.—Good-evening,
Miss Nora.—Good-evening, Dr
Whitaker.’</p>

<p>The mulatto’s eyes flashed fire, but he replied
with a low and stately bow, in suppressed accents:
‘I shall be ready to answer you in this matter
whenever you wish, Mr Dupuy—and with your
own weapon. Good-evening.’ And he held out
his arm quietly to Nora.</p>

<p>Nora rose and took the mulatto’s proffered arm
at once with a sweeping air of utter indifference.
‘Shall we take a turn round the gardens, Dr
Whitaker?’ she asked calmly, reassuring herself
at the same time with a rapid glance that nobody
except poor frightened Mrs Pereira had overheard
this short altercation.—‘How lovely the
moon looks to-night! What an exquisite undertone
of green in the long shadows of those
columns in the portico!’</p>

<p>‘Undertone of green!’ Tom Dupuy exclaimed
aloud in vulgar derision (he was too much of
a clod to see that his cue in the scene was fairly
past, and that dignity demanded of him now to
keep perfectly silent). ‘Undertone of green,
indeed, with her precious nigger!—Mrs Pereira,
this is your fault! A pretty sort of chaperon
<i>you</i> make, upon my word, to let her go and
engage herself to sit out a dance with a common
mulatto!—Where’s Uncle Theodore? Where is
he, I tell you? I shall run and fetch him this
very minute. I always said that in the end
that girl Nora would go and marry a woolly-headed
brown man.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p>Nora and the mulatto walked across the garden
in unbroken silence, past the fountain in the
centre of the courtyard; past the corridor by
the open supper-room; past the hanging lanterns
on the outer shrubbery; and down the
big flight of stone steps to the gravelled Italian
terrace that overlooked the deep tropical gully.
When they reached the foot of the staircase,
Nora said in as unconcerned a tone as she could
muster up: ‘Let us walk down here, away from
the house, Dr Whitaker. Tom may perhaps
send papa out to look for me, and I’d rather
not meet him till the next dance is well over.
Please take me along the terrace.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker turned with her silently along
the path, and uttered not a word till they
reached the marble seat at the end of the
creeper-covered balustrade. Then he sat down
moodily beside her, and said in what seemed
a perfectly unruffled voice: ‘Miss Dupuy, I am
not altogether sorry that this little incident has
turned out just as it has happened. It enables
you to judge for yourself the sort of insult that
men of my colour are liable to meet with here
in Trinidad.’</p>

<p>Nora fingered her fan nervously. ‘Tom
Dupuy’s always an unendurably rude fellow,’
she said, with affected carelessness. ‘He’s rude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">{279}</span>
by nature, you know, that’s the fact of it.
He’s rude to me. He’s rude to everybody.
He’s a boor, Dr Whitaker; a boor at heart.
You mustn’t take any notice of what he says
to you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; he <i>is</i> a boor, Miss Dupuy—and I shall
venture to say so, although he’s your own cousin—but
in what other country in the world would
such a boor venture to believe himself able to
look down upon other men, his equals in everything
except an accident of colour?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Dr Whitaker, you make too much altogether
of his rudeness. It isn’t personal to you;
it’s part of his nature.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Dupuy,’ the young mulatto burst out
suddenly, after a moment’s pause and internal
struggle, ‘I’m not sorry for it, as I said before;
for it gives me the opportunity of saying something
to you that I have long been waiting to
tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’—frigidly.</p>

<p>‘Well, it is this: I mean at once to leave
Trinidad.’</p>

<p>Nora started. It was not quite what she was
expecting. ‘To leave Trinidad, Dr Whitaker?
And where to go? Back to England?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, back to England.—Miss Dupuy, for
heaven’s sake, listen to me for a moment.
This dance won’t be very long. As soon as it’s
over, I must take you back to the ballroom. I
have only these few short minutes to speak to
you. I have been waiting long for them—looking
forward to them; hoping for them;
dreading them; foreseeing them. Don’t disappoint
me of my one chance of a hearing. Sit
here and hear me out: I beg of you—I implore
you.’</p>

<p>Nora’s fingers trembled terribly, and she felt
half inclined to rise at once and go back to
Mrs Pereira; but she could not find it in her
heart utterly to refuse that pleading tone of
profound emotion, even though it came from
only a brown man. ‘Well, Dr Whitaker,’ she
answered tremulously, ‘say on whatever you
have to say to me.’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to England, Miss Dupuy,’ the poor
young mulatto went on in broken accents; ‘I
can stand no longer the shame and misery of
my own surroundings in this island. You know
what they are. Picture them to yourself for a
moment. Forget you are a white woman, a
member of this old proud unforgiving aristocracy—“for
they ne’er pardon who have done the
wrong:” forget it for once, and try to think
how it would feel to you, after your English
up-bringing, with your tastes and ideas and habits
and sentiments, to be suddenly set down in the
midst of a society like that of the ignorant
coloured class here in Trinidad. On the one
side, contempt and contumely from the most
boorish and unlettered whites; on the other side,
utter uncongeniality with one’s own poor miserable
people. Picture it to yourself—how absolutely
unendurable!’</p>

<p>Nora bethought her silently of Tom Dupuy
from both points of view, and answered in a
low tone: ‘Dr Whitaker, I recognise the truth
of what you say. I—I am sorry for you; I
sympathise with you.’</p>

<p>It was a great deal for a daughter of the old
slave-owning oligarchy to say—how much, people
in England can hardly realise; and Dr Whitaker
accepted it gratefully. ‘It’s very kind of you,
Miss Dupuy,’ he went on again, the tears rising
quickly to his eyes, ‘very, very kind of you.
But the struggle is over; I can’t stand it any
longer; I mean at once to return to England.’</p>

<p>‘You will do wisely, I think,’ Nora answered,
looking at him steadily.</p>

<p>‘I will do wisely,’ he repeated in a wandering
tone. ‘Yes, I will do wisely. But, Miss Dupuy,
strange to say, there is one thing that still binds
me down to Trinidad.—Oh, for heaven’s sake,
listen to me, and don’t condemn me unheard.—No,
no, I beg of you, don’t rise yet! I will
be brief. Hear me out, I implore of you, I
implore of you! I am only a mulatto, I know;
but mulattoes have a heart as well as white
men—better than some, I do honestly believe.
Miss Dupuy, from the very first moment I saw
you, I—I loved you! yes, I <i>will</i> say it—I loved
you!—I loved you!’</p>

<p>Nora rose, and stood erect before him, proud
but tremulous, in her girlish beauty. ‘Dr
Whitaker,’ she said, in a very calm tone, ‘I
knew it; I saw it. From the first moment
you ever spoke to me, I knew it perfectly.’</p>

<p>He drew a long breath to still the violent
throbbing of his heart. ‘You knew it,’ he said,
almost joyously—‘you knew it! And you did
not repel me! Oh, Miss Dupuy, for one of your
blood and birth, that was indeed a great condescension!’</p>

<p>Nora hesitated. ‘I liked you, Dr Whitaker,’
she answered slowly—‘I liked you, and I was
sorry for you.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you. Whatever else you
say, for that one word I thank you earnestly.
But oh, what more can I say to you? I love
you; I have always loved you. I shall always
love you in future. Take me or reject me, I
shall always love you. And yet, how can I ask
you? But in England—in England, Miss Dupuy,
the barrier would be less absolute.—Yes, yes;
I know how hopeless it is: but this once—this
once only! I <i>must</i> ask you! Oh, for pity’s
sake, in England—far away from it all—in
London—where nobody thinks of these things!
Why, I know a Hindu barrister—— But there!
it’s not a matter for reasoning; it lies between
heart and heart! Oh, Miss Dupuy, tell me—tell
me, tell me, is there—is there any chance for
me?’</p>

<p>Nora’s heart relented within her. ‘Dr Whitaker,’
she said slowly and remorsefully, ‘you
can’t tell how much I feel for you. I can see
at once what a dreadful position you are placed
in. I can see, of course, how impossible it is
for you ever to think of marrying any—any
lady of your own colour—at least as they are
brought up here in Trinidad. I can see that
you could only fall in love with—with a white
lady, a person fitted by education and manners
to be a companion to you. I know how clever
you are, and I think I can see how good you
are too. I know how far all your tastes and
ideas are above those of the people you must
mix with here, or, for that matter, above Tom
Dupuy’s—or my own either. I see it all; I
know it all. And indeed, I like you—I admire
you, and I like you. I don’t want you to think
me unkind and unappreciative.—Dr Whitaker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">{280}</span>
I feel truly flattered that you should speak
so to me this evening—but’—— And she hesitated.
The young mulatto felt that that ‘but’
was the very deathblow to his last faint hope
and aspiration. ‘But—— Well, you know
these things are something more than a mere
matter of liking and admiring. Let us still be
friends, Dr Whitaker—let us still be friends.—And
there’s the band striking up the next
waltz. Will you kindly take me back to the
ballroom? I—I am engaged to dance it with
Captain Castello.’</p>

<p>‘One second, Miss Dupuy—for God’s sake, one
second! Is that final? Is that irrevocable?’</p>

<p>‘Final, Dr Whitaker—quite final. I like you;
I admire you; but I can never, never—never
accept you!’</p>

<p>The mulatto uttered a little low sharp piercing
cry. ‘Ah!’ he exclaimed in an accent of terrible
despair, ‘then it is all over—all, all over!’ Next
instant he had drawn himself together with an
effort again, and offering Nora his arm with constrained
calmness, he began to lead her back
towards the crowded ballroom. As he neared the
steps, he paused once more for a second, and
almost whispered in her ear in a hollow voice:
‘Thank you, thank you for ever for at least
your sympathy!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MAN-LIKE_APESAND_MAN">MAN-LIKE APES—AND MAN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Man-like</span>, or in scientific parlance, Anthropoid
Apes, are distinguished from others of the
monkey tribe on account of their greater size
and their greater resemblance to the human
species. Within the last quarter of a century,
they have, owing to the growing prominence of
the doctrine of evolution, been raised to a much
higher place than before as subjects of study
for the naturalist, the scientist, the philosopher.
From being little other than mere curiosities
in animal life, they have become important
objects of psychological inquiry, and have taken
their place as factors not to be overlooked in
the elevated regions of speculative thought. This
is due almost solely to the change that has
passed over our methods of studying animal life.
We have ceased to regard the lower creatures
as little better than pieces of living mechanism,
and have come to view them as vital steps in
the great ladder of progression which connects
the higher with the lower orders of organic
existence. Hence it is not now a matter of
wonder that a whole volume of the ‘International
Scientific Series’ should be devoted to
the study of Man-like Apes. The volume,
<i>Anthropoid Apes</i> (London: Kegan Paul &amp; Co.),
is from the pen of Professor Hartmann of
Berlin, and forms the fifty-third of the above
valuable series of works.</p>

<p>On account, says the author, of their external
bodily characteristics, of their anatomical structure,
and their highly developed intelligence,
Anthropoids not only stand first among apes,
but they take a still higher place, approximating
to the human species. Their fossil remains
carry us into a far-back period of prehistoric
time; and even within historic times, we have
them mentioned as early as 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> They
were then known to the Carthaginians, who
call them ‘<i>gorillai</i>,’ and describe them as hairy
silvan creatures who replied to the attacks of
the seafarers by throwing stones at them.</p>

<p>The gorilla, the chimpanzee, the orang-utan,
and the gibbon, are the chief of the animals included
under the title Anthropoid Apes. They
differ from each other and among themselves in
external form according to the age and sex,
the difference between the sexes being most
strongly marked in the gorilla, and least
apparent in the gibbon. ‘When a young male
gorilla is compared with an aged animal of the
same species, we are almost tempted to believe
that we have to do with two entirely different
creatures.’ Into the distinguishing physiological
peculiarities of the external form of these creatures,
we cannot of course enter here, and must
refer to the full and elaborate investigations
placed on record by Professor Hartmann.</p>

<p>Among the Anthropoids, the gorilla, the ‘prototype
of the species,’ deserves our notice first.
The aged male gorilla, in the full strength of
his bodily development, is a creature of terrible
aspect. This animal, when standing upright,
is more than six feet in height. The hinder
part of the head is broader below than above,
and the projecting arches above the eyes give
a peculiar prominence to this part of the skull.
‘The dark eyes glow between the lids with a
ferocious expression.’ The neck is very powerful,
almost like that of a bull, and the shoulders
are remarkable for their breadth. The arms are
very long, and of enormous strength; but the
legs short and feeble in proportion. The gorilla
inhabits the forests of West Africa, and is sometimes
seen in large numbers on the sea-coast,
probably driven thither from the interior by a
scarcity of food. The gorilla, moreover, lives in
a society consisting of male and female, with
their young of varying ages, and the family
group inhabits the recesses of the forest. According
to one observer, they frequent the same
sleeping-place not more than three or four
times consecutively, and usually spend the night
wherever they happen to be when night comes
on. The male gorilla chooses a suitable tree,
not very high, and by twisting and bending the
branches, constructs a kind of rude bed or nest
for his family. He himself spends the night
under the tree, and thus protects the female
and their young from the nocturnal attacks of
leopards, which are always ready to devour all
species of apes. In the daytime, the gorillas
roam through the forest in search of the favourite
leaves or fruits which form their food.</p>

<p>In walking, gorillas place the backs of their
closed fingers on the ground, or more rarely
support themselves on the flat palm, while
the bent soles of the feet are also in contact
with the ground. Their gait is tottering;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">{281}</span>
the movement of the body, which is never
in an upright position as in man, but bent
forward, rolls to some extent from one side to
another. They are skilful climbers, and when
ranging from tree to tree, will go to their very
tops. The gorilla is regarded as a dreadful
and very dangerous animal by the negroes who
inhabit the same country; though Professor
Hartmann considers that Du Chaillu’s descriptions
are greatly exaggerated ‘for the benefit
of his readers.’ When the animal is scared by
man, he generally takes to flight screaming,
and he only assumes the defensive if wounded
or driven into a corner. At such times his
size, strength, and dexterity combine to render
him a formidable enemy. ‘He sends forth a
kind of howl or furious yelp, stands up on his
hind-legs like an enraged bear, advances with
clumsy gait in this position and attacks his
enemy. At the same time the hair on his
head and the nape of his neck stands erect,
his teeth are displayed, and his eyes flash with
savage fury. He beats his massive breast with
his fists, or beats the air with them. Koppenfels
says that if no further provocation is given,
and his opponent gradually retreats before the
animal’s rage has reached its highest point, he
does not return to the attack. In other cases
he parries the blow directed against him with
the skill of a practised fighter; and, as is also
done by the bear, he grasps his opponent by
the arm and crunches it, or else throws the
man down and rends him with his terrible
canine teeth.’</p>

<p>Enough of this silvan monster in his wild
state. Let us turn to him in captivity; and we
can only take one out of several individuals
described. The one referred to was caught
young, and gradually accustomed to a mixed
diet preparatory to his being brought from
Africa to Europe. While still with his first
possessors, he was allowed to run about as he
chose, being only watched as little children are
watched. He clung to human companionship;
showed no trace of mischievous, malicious, or
savage qualities, but was sometimes self-willed.
He expressed the ideas which occurred to him
by different sounds, one of which was the
characteristic tone of importunate petition, while
other sounds expressed fright or horror, and in
rare instances a sullen and defiant growl might
be heard. In moments of exuberant satisfaction,
he would raise himself on his hind-legs, rub his
breast with both fists, or, after quite a human
fashion, clap his hands together—this an action
which no one had taught him. His dexterity in
eating was particularly remarkable. He took up
a cup or glass with instinctive care, clasped the
vessel with both hands, and set it down again so
softly and carefully that the narrator cannot
remember his breaking a single article of household
goods. ‘His behaviour at meal-times was
quiet and mannerly; he only took as much as
he could hold with his thumb, fore, and middle
finger, and looked on with indifference when
any of the different forms of food heaped up
before him were taken away. If, however, nothing
was given him, he growled impatiently, looked
narrowly at all the dishes from his place at
table, and accompanied every plate carried off
by the negro boys with an angry snarl, or a
short resentful cough, and sometimes he sought
to seize the arm of the passer-by, in order to
express his displeasure more plainly by a bite
or a blow. He drank by suction, stooping over
the vessel, without even putting his hands into
it or upsetting it, and in the case of smaller
vessels, he carried them to his mouth.’ He was
clever in manifesting his wishes, and often
expressed them in an urgent and caressing
manner. Child-like, he took a special pleasure
in making a noise by beating on hollow articles,
and he seldom omitted an opportunity of drumming
on casks, dishes, or tin trays, whenever
he passed by them. After being brought to
Berlin, however, he did not live long, dying of
a ‘galloping consumption.’</p>

<p>The second species of anthropoid apes is the
chimpanzee. The full-grown animal of this
species is smaller than the adult gorilla. An
aged male chimpanzee has broad, rather rounded
shoulders, a powerful chest, long muscular arms
reaching to the knees, and a long hand, which
seems to be very slender in comparison with that
of the gorilla. Like the latter animal, he is a
denizen of forests, and subsists on wild fruits
of various kinds. He lives either in separate
families or in small groups of families. Where
he inhabits the forest regions of Central Africa,
his habits are more arboreal than those of the
gorilla; elsewhere, as on the south-west coast,
he seems to live more upon the ground. His
gait is weak and vacillating, and he can stand
erect but a short time. These animals send
forth loud cries; and the horrible wails, the
furious shrieks and howls that may be heard
morning and evening, and often in the night,
make these creatures truly hateful to travellers.
When chimpanzees are attacked, they strike the
ground with their hands, but they do not, as
the gorilla does, beat their breasts with their
fists. As for the penthouses which Du Chaillu
asserts these animals build, Professor Hartmann
is somewhat doubtful regarding them. An illustration
of this structure, as given by Du
Chaillu, has been imitated in London, but this,
in Hartmann’s opinion, has been embellished.
‘Koppenfels believes that the so-called penthouse
is only the family nest, under which the male
places himself; while Reichenfels thinks it possible
that some parasitic growth, perhaps a
<i>Loranthus</i>, gave rise to the belief that such a
penthouse is erected.’</p>

<p>A male chimpanzee, which was kept in the
Berlin Aquarium in 1876, was remarkable for
his excessive liveliness, and was on particularly
friendly terms with a little two-year-old boy, the
son of Dr Hermes, the director of the aquarium.
‘When the child entered the room, the chimpanzee
ran to meet him, embraced and kissed
him, seized his hand and drew him to the sofa,
that they might play together. The child was
often rough with his playfellow, pulling him by
the mouth, pinching his ears, or lying on him,
yet the chimpanzee was never known to lose
his temper. He behaved very differently to boys
between six and ten years old. When a number
of schoolboys visited the office, he ran towards
them, went from one to the other, shook one of
them, bit the leg of another, seized the jacket of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">{282}</span>
a third with the right hand, jumped up, and
with the left gave him a sound box on the ear.
In short, he played the wildest pranks. It seemed
as if he were infected with the joyous excitement
of youth, which induced him to riot with the
troop of schoolboys.’</p>

<p>One day when Dr Hermes gave his nine-year-old
son a slight tap on the head for some blunder
in his arithmetic, the chimpanzee, who was also
sitting at the table, thought it his duty likewise
to show his displeasure, and gave the boy a sound
box on the ear. If, again, Dr Hermes pointed out
to him that some one was staring or mocking at
him, and said: ‘Do not put up with it,’ the creature
cried, ‘Oh! oh!’ and rushed at the person
in question in order to strike or bite him, or
express his displeasure in some other way. When
he saw the director was writing, he often seized a
pen, dipped it in the inkstand, and scrawled upon
the paper. ‘He displayed a special talent for
cleaning the window-panes of the aquarium. It
was amusing to see him squeezing up the cloth,
moistening the pane with his lips, and then
rubbing it hard, passing quickly from one place
to another.’</p>

<p>Of a female chimpanzee, Massica by name, kept
in the Dresden Zoological Gardens, some extraordinary
things are told. She was a remarkable
creature, not only in her external habits, but in
her disposition. ‘At one moment she would sit
still with a brooding air, only occasionally darting
a mischievous, flashing glance at the spectators;
at another she took pleasure in feats of strength,
or she roamed to and fro in her spacious inclosure
like an angry beast of prey.’ She would
sometimes rattle the bars of her cage with a
violence that made the spectators uneasy; at
other times would claw at people who entered
the vestibule of her cage, and try to tear their
clothes. She was fond of playing with old hats,
which she set upon her head, and if the top
was quite torn off, she drew it down upon
her neck.</p>

<p>But Massica was frequently ungovernable. She
hardly obeyed any one except Schöpf, the director
of the gardens; and when in good-humour she
would sit on his knee and put her muscular arms
round his neck with a caressing gesture. But, in
spite of this, he was never quite secure from her
roguish tricks. She was able to use a spoon,
though somewhat awkwardly; and she could
pour from larger vessels into smaller ones without
spilling the liquor. If she was left alone
for any time, she tried to open the lock of her
cage; and she once succeeded in doing so, but
on that occasion she stole the key. It was
kept hanging on the wall; and she, observing
it, took it down, hid it in her armpit, and crept
quietly back to her cage. When the occasion
served her purpose, with the key she easily
opened the lock, and walked out. She also
knew how to use a gimlet, to wring out wet
clothes, and to blow her nose with a handkerchief.
If allowed to do so, she would draw
off the keeper’s boots, then scramble with them
up to some place out of reach, and, when he
asked for them, throw them at his head. She,
like the clever gorilla before described, died of
consumption. When her illness began, she
became apathetic, and looked about with a
vacant, unobservant stare. Just before her death,
she put her arms round Schöpf’s neck when he
came to visit her, looked at him placidly, kissed
him three times, stretched out her hands to him,
and died. ‘The last moments of Anthropoids,’
remarks our author, ‘have their tragic side!’</p>

<p>Did space permit, we might give many other
details of a similar character as to the habits of
the orang-utan, the gibbon, and others of the
larger apes, both in their wild state and in captivity;
but the above are sufficient to illustrate
the family to which they belong. A much more
interesting matter remains to be considered,
namely, what is called the ‘anthropomorphism’ of
these creatures, that is, their relation physically
to the highest of all the mammalia, man.</p>

<p>Professor Hartmann observes that Huxley’s
statement, that the lowest apes are further
removed from the highest apes than the latter
are from men, is, according to his experience,
still perfectly valid. ‘It cannot be denied that
the highest order of the animal world is closely
connected with the highest created being.’ But
it does not follow therefrom that man is descended
from apes, or is simply an improved kind of ape.
There is, we fear, still prevailing among large
sections of intelligent persons the belief that
Darwin’s theory was intended to prove that the
monkey was the progenitor of man. Of course
no one who reads Darwin’s works for himself
would ever go away with such a misconception
of the whole question. What Darwin’s hypothesis
suggested was, not that man was descended from
the monkey, but that both man and the monkey
may be descendants of a common progenitor, a
common type, now extinct, and of which no
indisputable traces have yet been found. From
this common type, or ground-form, so to speak,
the process of development may, according to
Darwin, have resulted in two distinct branches or
offshoots—the one branch of development ending
in the monkey tribe, the other branch ending in
man. It is, in the absence of any certain traces
of the extinct common type or progenitor, not
a subject on which to dogmatise, but is a theory
or hypothesis which, in the opinion of Darwin
and many other scientists after him, best accounts
for the morphological development of man viewed
merely from the physical side.</p>

<p>Professor Hartmann admits that his investigations
have not brought the problem any nearer
to a solution. A baby gorilla is much nearer
in physical constitution to a human baby, than
the full-grown gorilla is to the mature man;
thus indicating that the process of development
within the lifetime of an Anthropoid is not in the
direction of improvement or further approximation
to the human type, but is in the direction
of retrogression, or further removal from the
human type. ‘A great chasm,’ he says, ‘between
Man and Anthropoids is constituted, as I believe,
by the fact that the human race is capable of
education, and is able to acquire the highest
mental culture, while the most intelligent Anthropoid
can only receive a certain mechanical
training. And even to this training a limit is
set by the surly temper displayed by Anthropoids
as they get older.’ So that it would seem as if
the development of the Anthropoids morally, if
we may so use the word here, is, like their
physical development, not one of progress or
improvement <i>in the individual</i>. These larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">{283}</span>
apes, therefore, with all their striking resemblances
to the human form, are not moving
nearer towards Man, but merely remain Man-like.</p>

<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN THREE CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about eight o’clock on a certain November
evening in the year 188-, that I found myself one
of a number of passengers disgorged from a train
on the platform of the St Pancras Station. I
was just turned nineteen years of age, and this
was the first time I had set foot in London. My
journey had been a long and tedious one, and
I was thoroughly chilled and worn out when I
stepped out of the carriage. I had started from
home at six in the morning for a twelve miles’
walk to the nearest station, and after that, had
spent hour after hour, first in one third-class
carriage, and then in another, for my home was
in a remote district many miles from any main
line to the metropolis. I may just add that I
had but lately recovered from a long illness,
having outgrown my strength—or so my friends
averred—and to that fact some portion of the
weariness I now felt was no doubt attributable.</p>

<p>However, here I was at last, really and truly,
in London—in the great city. It was the consummation
of the dreams of my youth, as it is
of the dreams of so many hundreds of ambitious,
country-bred lads. I had no luggage to detain
me, the sole article I had brought with me being
a small handbag containing a few necessaries:
my portmanteau was to follow in the course of
a couple of days. As I was making my way
towards the exit, I caught sight of the refreshment
room. I had had nothing to eat since
morning but a few biscuits, and now the pangs
of hunger began to make themselves felt. I
pushed open the swing-doors of the restaurant,
and going up to the counter, I asked for a cup
of coffee and a couple of sandwiches. While I
was being served, I counted over again the small
amount of money in my purse and asked myself
whether I could afford to take a cab to my destination.
Why not walk? The night was young,
and the street in which my friend lived, being in
the heart of London, could not be more than two
or, at the most, three miles away. Besides, there
seemed a spice of adventure, something that would
serve me to talk about in time to come, in finding
my way, utter stranger as I was, alone and by
night through the streets of London—those streets
about which I had read so much, and had so
often pictured in my thoughts. I decided that
I would walk.</p>

<p>Here it becomes needful to mention that my
destination was the lodgings of a certain friend,
whose name, for the purposes of this narrative,
shall be Gascoigne. I call him my friend, and
such he was, although he was four years older
than myself. We were both natives of the same
small country town; his parents and mine were
old friends; and owing to the similarity of our
tastes and pursuits, he and I had been much
thrown together up to the date of his leaving
home to push his fortunes in London. We had
kept up an unbroken correspondence after his
departure; and now that my father had lighted
on evil days, and it became imperative that I
should turn out into the world, Gascoigne had
at once come to the rescue. I must leave home,
he wrote, and take up my quarters with him
till he should succeed in finding some situation
that would be likely to suit me, which he had
little doubt about being able to do in the course
of a few weeks at the most. And thus it fell
out that here I was in London.</p>

<p>Outside the station, I found a policeman, from
whom I inquired my nearest way to the Strand,
in a street off which thoroughfare Gascoigne’s
rooms were situated. The night was damp and
raw, with a sort of thin, wet mist in the atmosphere,
which blurred the lamps and the lights
in the shops a little way off, and made the pavement
greasy and unpleasant to walk on. But
little recked I about the weather. I was pacing
London streets, and to me, for the time being,
that was all-sufficient. The coffee had warmed
me; the fatigue I had felt previously was forgotten
as I walked on and on in a sort of waking
dream. More than once I had to ask my way,
and more than once I wandered from the direct
road; but at length, after about an hour’s walking,
I found the street I was in search of, and two
minutes later I knocked at the door of No. 16.
My summons was responded to by a middle-aged
woman—Gascoigne’s landlady, as I afterwards
found—who, in answer to my inquiry, informed
me that my friend had been called out of town
two days previously on important business, and
was not expected home till the morrow. I turned
from the door with a sinking heart, feeling more
lost and lonely than I had ever felt before. I
was in the heart of the great Babylon, and knew
not a single soul out of all the teeming thousands
around me. Presently, I found myself in
the Strand again, and there I came to a halt for a
little while, gazing on a scene so fresh and strange
to me. The glare, the uproar, the interminable
tangle of vehicles, the hundreds of human beings,
young and old, rich and poor, passing ceaselessly
to and fro, winding in and out without touching
each other, like midges dancing in the sun—all
these affected my spirits like a tonic, and in a
very little while put all morbid fancies to flight.
What if I were alone in London without a creature
anywhere that I knew—there were thousands
of others in a similar plight. Gascoigne
would be back on the morrow, and for this one
night I must make shift with a bed at some decent
coffee-house or inexpensive hotel. It was too
early yet to think of turning in; it would be
time enough an hour hence to set about finding
quarters for the night.</p>

<p>I wandered on, heedless whither my footsteps
might lead me, my weariness all but forgotten
in the novelty of the scenes which met my
country-bred eyes at every turn. As the clocks
were striking ten, I found myself on one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">{284}</span>
bridges, gazing over the parapet at the black-flowing
river as it washed and swirled through
the arches under my feet. A thick fog was
slowly creeping up, and even while I was gazing
at the fringe of lamps on some other bridge,
its dark mantle closed round them, and shut
them in as completely as though they had never
been. A few minutes later, the fog had reached
the spot where I was standing, and had caught
me in a damp, sickly embrace, which in a very
little while sufficed to chill me to the marrow,
and blotted out as completely as with a wet
sponge all the seething world around me.</p>

<p>When I began to move again after my halt, I
realised for the first time how thoroughly weary
and dead-beat I was, and that I must no longer
delay seeking out a lodging for the night. The
fog was thickening fast, and it was impossible to
see more than three or four yards in any direction.
In my bewilderment, instead of turning
back towards the Strand side of the bridge, as
my intention was, I seem to have unwittingly
crossed to the Surrey side, seeing that, a few
minutes later, I found myself in a maze of narrow,
tortuous streets, in which gin palaces and fried-fish
shops seemed to be the chief places of entertainment.</p>

<p>I wandered on, turning from one thoroughfare
into another, feeling in that thick, black fog more
utterly lost and bewildered, even in the streets
of London, than I should have done if set down
at midnight in the heart of Salisbury Plain with
nothing but the stars to guide me on my way.
In the district in which I now found myself
there seemed to be no small hotels where a
stranger might find cheap but decent accommodation
for the night—nothing but flaring
taverns and low coffee-shops. Three or four of
these latter I passed which, even dead-beat as
I was, I could not summon up courage to enter—they
looked too unsavoury and repulsive to
a youth of countrified tastes like myself. At
length I came to one which seemed more promising
than any I had yet seen—cleaner and
neater in every way, as far as I could judge by
peering through the window. It was merely a
coffee-shop, with some cups and saucers and a
few muffins, teacakes, and other comestibles in
the window; but what had more attraction for
me than anything else was the welcome legend,
‘Good Beds,’ painted in black letters on the
lamp over the door. I hesitated no longer, but
pushed open the swing-doors and entered.</p>

<p>My first glance round showed me that the
place was one much frequented by foreigners;
and when the <i>cafetier</i> himself came down the
room to inquire my pleasure, I saw at once that,
whatever else his nationality might be, he was
certainly not an Englishman. My wants were
simple—a chop and some coffee. I put the question
of bed aside for the present, till I should
have seen more of the place and its frequenters.
The <i>cafetier</i> answered me with much politeness,
but in very broken English, that my requirements
should be at once attended to, and that,
meanwhile—with a comprehensive wave of his
hand—the newspapers, English and foreign, were
at the service of monsieur. He did not look
much like a coffee-house keeper, with his long
grizzled hair, his high bald forehead, his dark
deep-set eyes, in each of which glowed a spark
of vivid fire, and his thin white hands; there
seemed about him too much of the air of a
man of breeding and education for such an
occupation.</p>

<p>He was still addressing himself to me, when
there was a sudden irruption into the room of
a little black-eyed, short-haired, bullet-headed
waiter, French or Swiss most probably, in a
black jacket and short white apron, who, dancing
up to me, took possession of me at once, divined
my wants in a moment, and pirouetted off to
fetch me my coffee, pending the cooking of my
chop, leaving his master extinguished, so to
speak, both morally and physically. ‘Ah, Jean
will attend to monsieur,’ said the latter, putting
his hands to his sides and straightening his long
thin back. ‘Jean, he is a good fellow, and will
make monsieur comfortable.’ And with that he
lounged slowly away to a small counter at the
upper end of the room, behind which he seated
himself, and became at once immersed in the
perusal of some foreign journal.</p>

<p>I was still looking at him, sitting with my
arms folded over the table, when my eyelids
closed unconsciously, and I dropped asleep as
I sat—but only for a few moments, for Jean
was quickly at my side with the coffee and a
roll, flicking some imaginary crumbs off the
table with his <i>serviette</i> as a polite way of arousing
me. A draught of coffee imparted new life to
me for a time, and I could afford to look round
with some degree of curiosity. In all, there
were about a dozen people in the place. Two
or three customers got up and went away, while
others came in and took their places. Others
there were who seemed habitual frequenters of
the place, and sat playing draughts or dominoes,
smoking their cigarettes, and sipping at their
coffee or chocolate between times. Only one
here and there was English; the rest of them
were unmistakable foreigners, of various types
and nationalities, but all readily recognisable as
such even to my untutored eyes. Nimble-handed
Jean was equal to the requirements of each and
all.</p>

<p>Seated at one of the narrow tables on the
opposite side of the room, and facing the door,
was a man who took my attention more than
any one there, the <i>cafetier</i> excepted. He was a
full-cheeked, heavy-browed man, not tall, but
strongly built, and with something of that added
corpulence which so often comes with middle
age. He had close-cropped iron-gray hair, which
stood out like a stiff stubble in every direction;
but his moustache and imperial were jet black,
and therefore presumably dyed. He had a rather
thick aquiline nose, and he wore a pair of gold-rimmed
spectacles; but once or twice I caught
a glance from his eyes, which were steel-gray
in colour, so keen and piercing, that his assumption
of artificial aid for them seemed somewhat
of a mockery. He was dressed in a tightly
buttoned black frock-coat, and wore a wisp of
black ribbon round his neck, tied in a formal
little bow under his turn-down collar. His
trousers were dark gray in colour, and his feet
were incased in a pair of broad-toed varnished
boots. His rather large plump hands were
white and shapely, and his filbert nails were
carefully trimmed. He looked so superior to
the general run of the other frequenters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">{285}</span>
coffee-shop whom I had hitherto seen, that he
had an air of being altogether out of place. He
neither spoke to nor was addressed by any one
except Jean, who served him with his chocolate,
but seemed immersed in the contents first of
one foreign newspaper and then of another,
several of which were spread on the table in
front of him. Still, notwithstanding his seeming
indifference to everything that was going on
around him, an impression somehow got possession
of me that not a man entered or left the
place without being keenly scrutinised from
behind those gold-rimmed spectacles, while more
than once I had an uneasy consciousness that I
was the object who was being photographed by
that coldly penetrative gaze.</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished my chop, Jean came
to clear the table, upon which I took the opportunity
of saying to him: ‘I shall require a bed
here to-night. I suppose you can find room for
me?’</p>

<p>He stared at me for a moment or two in open-eyed
astonishment. Then he said: ‘Monsieur is
mistaken. We have no beds for strangers here.’</p>

<p>‘Then why have you the announcement of
“Good Beds” painted up on the lamp outside?’
I demanded a little hotly.</p>

<p>Jean shrugged his shoulders. ‘Ah, that is a
mistake—all at once a mistake,’ he answered with
his strong French accent. ‘The Englishman who
had this place before Monsieur Karavich, used
to let out beds; but Monsieur Karavich, who has
been here but two months, does not. No.’</p>

<p>At this juncture M. Karavich himself appeared
on the scene. He had come to ascertain what
the discussion was about. He put a question
to Jean in French, and the latter answered him
volubly in the same language.</p>

<p>‘Jean is right, monsieur,’ said the <i>cafetier</i> to
me in his broken English, which I had some
difficulty in comprehending, and with an air of
polite deprecation. ‘We do not let out beds
to strangers. The lamp shall be altered to-morrow.
I am sorry—truly sorry, monsieur.’</p>

<p>‘So am I sorry,’ I answered stoutly. ‘I am
an utter stranger in London, never having set
foot in it till three hours ago, and I know no
more where I am than the man in the moon.
Besides, think of the fog! What am I, a stranger,
to do if turned out into the midst of it? You
can surely find me a bed somewhere. I don’t
care how humble it is—and it’s only for one
night. Put your head outside the door, monsieur,
and see for yourself whether on such a night you
would turn even a dog into the streets.’</p>

<p>The <i>cafetier</i> spoke to Jean in some language
with which I had no acquaintance. Jean replied
volubly as usual. Then the <i>cafetier</i> spoke again,
but this time his voice had an imperative tone
in it such as I had not noticed before. Jean
turned pale, and replied, not in words, but by
turning out the palms of his hands and spreading
wide his fingers. It was an answer replete with
significance. Turning to me, the <i>cafetier</i> said, in
his slow, hesitating tones: ‘I will find monsieur
a bed. He is a stranger and an Englishman and
claims my hospitality: that is enough for Fedor
Karavich.’</p>

<p>I did not fail to thank him. He smiled faintly,
made me a little bow, and went slowly back to
his counter. When I turned my eyes on Jean,
he was scowling at me most unmistakably. What
could I possibly have done to annoy the sprightly
little man?</p>

<p>The stranger with the gold spectacles pushed
away his newspapers and rose to go. Jean helped
him on with his fur-lined overcoat, and as he
did so, a quick whisper passed between the two.
Then Jean left him. The stranger put on his
hat, and coming down a pace or two till he
stood close by the end of my table, he proceeded
to leisurely button up his coat. I happened to
look up, and our eyes met. The stranger smiled,
and said in a soft, pleasant voice, in which there
was the faintest perceptible trace of a foreign
accent: ‘Pardon, but I think I heard monsieur
say just now that he was a stranger in London.
Is that not so?’</p>

<p>‘Quite a stranger,’ I replied. ‘I only arrived
here three hours ago, and was never in London
before.’</p>

<p>I was glad to have some one to speak to, were
it only this pleasant-voiced foreigner; it seemed
in some measure to take off the edge of my loneliness.</p>

<p>‘Again pardon,’ said the other; ‘but monsieur
would naturally find the fog outside rather bewildering?
Ah, your English climate! He would
be puzzled, for instance, to find his way from
this house to Charing Cross, or even to the
nearest bridge; is it not so?’</p>

<p>‘Faith, you’re right there,’ I answered with
a laugh. ‘I have not the slightest idea of the
locality of this house, nor even on which side
the river it is situated. But daylight will solve
my difficulties in that respect.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that daylight is a great tell-tale,’ answered
the stranger with the ghost of a shrug. ‘Bon
soir, monsieur; I hope you will sleep well, and
have pleasant dreams.’</p>

<p>Again the same inscrutable smile flitted across
his face. Raising his hat slightly, he pushed
open the swing-doors, and passed out into the
fog and darkness.</p>

<p>It was growing late by this time. Besides
myself, there were only two customers now left
in the place, who seemed still as intent on their
game of dominoes as they had been when I went
in. Summoning Jean, I asked to be shown to
my room.</p>

<p>I think the bedroom into which I was presently
inducted was the very smallest in which it was
ever my lot to sleep, while the bed itself was
so short, that a tall lanky fellow such as I was
might well wonder how his length of limb was
to be packed away in so small a compass. On
turning down the bedclothes, the sheets and
pillow-cases, to my countrified eyes, accustomed
to the snowiest of linen, looked far too dingy
to be at all inviting. It seemed to me that
they had not been changed for a considerable
period; but be that as it may, I had no inclination
to trust myself into too close contact with
their dubious purity. I was tired enough to
sleep anywhere, and had there been anything
in the shape of an easy-chair in the room, I
would have made that my couch for the night.
What I did was to take off my collar, boots,
and coat, lie down on the bed, turn up the
counterpane over me on both sides, and lay my
coat over that. Thousands in London that night
had a far worse bed than mine. Leaving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">{286}</span>
end of candle which Jean had given me to burn
itself out, three minutes later I was in a sound
dreamless sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORTUNE">FORTUNE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> a deplorable limitation of the meaning of
the word, it has come about that the idea
suggested to most minds by the expression
‘fortune’ or ‘a fortunate man’ is the accumulation
of wealth. It would seem, therefore, that,
in the popular estimation, no man is fortunate
who is not in the possession of riches. A little
thought, above all a little experience of life, will
soon convince us that this is not the case; and
so far is it from being true, that wealth will be
found to be but a small and solitary factor in
those various accidents or providences of our
lives from which we derive our happiness. The
sordid wooer in the ballad, who asked, ‘What is
your fortune, my pretty maid?’ knew of no
fortune beside that of riches. The pretty and
witty maid knew better. ‘My face is my fortune,
sir,’ she said; and let in a flood of unaccustomed
light upon the benighted mind of her
baffled suitor, to whom it had never occurred
that fortune might consist in beauty and the
qualities that win love and admiration.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether a man who, by a stroke
or two of the pen, can flutter the innocent dovecots
of the Exchange, is, by virtue of that power,
any happier than the humble farmer whose year’s
income may be straitened by one night’s rain.
Far in advance of wealth, in estimating what
meed of fortune has fallen to any man’s lot,
should be placed health, upon the state of which
our welfare so largely depends, and the preservation
of which is so nearly contingent upon the
method of life we adopt. Riches without health
do not bring with them the capacity for their
enjoyment; and yet how many of us waste the
latter in the pursuit of the former! The merchant
who rises early and toils till a late hour
at his desk in the sunless city office for the sake
of amassing money, has generally advanced far
beyond middle age before his object is attained,
and finds then that he has lost the faculty of
enjoyment. Leisure has become a weariness to
him; the pursuits for which he once coveted
it have lost their attraction for him; the studies
he once desired opportunities to follow up, have
lost their interest; he has no longer the robust
health and bodily strength demanded for the
sports and pastimes which once seemed to him
to make life worth living. Without the accustomed
occupation, the day is a blank; he must
still journey to the office, still add sovereign to
sovereign, and take what comfort is possible from
the reflection that another may perhaps spend
them, and that they may serve to keep in ease
and idleness one who never worked for them—a
poor and second-hand solace, indeed, for no
man yet ever started life with the intention of
acquiring wealth for the sole benefit of his successor.
The proper image of such a man, wearing
out his days in the dull monotonous round of
business, is the ass in the great hollow wheel
of the water-well in Carisbrooke Castle, which
walks for ever up-hill, but which never advances,
and never rises, and the end of whose labour is
to draw water that others may drink it.</p>

<p>With numerically unimportant exceptions, we
have all to toil for our living; and it is probable
that that man is most truly described as
fortunate who at the outset in life has chosen
work in which he can take pleasure. To labour
during the best hours of the day in hatred or
contempt of the task, for the sake of the few
hours of leisure that are thereby earned, will
in the long-run weaken the moral fibre and lower
the vitality; and those hours of leisure will
probably be wasted when won. But he who
has been fortunate enough to find work for his
hands to do which will bring him food and
shelter, and in which at the same time his soul
can rejoice, will lay aside his task with a spirit
fresh for a new study, a new enterprise, or with
a zest for innocent and healthy enjoyment.</p>

<p>The artist who labours to create forms, hues,
and ideas of beauty; the author who enriches
the world with fresh treasures of thought; the
physician whose aim and whose reward is to
relieve suffering; the carpenter to whom his
craft is a pride and a triumph; the labourer in
the field who loves the soil he tills, and delights
to watch from season to season the checkered
success of his operations: these, and such as
these, are the truly fortunate men, into whose
annual money-winnings we have no need to
inquire before pronouncing them happy. Here,
again, our lot is to a large extent in our own
hands; for though we have not all the professions
and occupations of life offered to our
choice, yet some selection is open to us, and it
behoves us to choose both wisely and boldly, and
it is an instance where boldness is often wisdom.
Even where the choice presented to us is so
narrow as seemingly to preclude all chance of
satisfying our aspirations, there is but little work
in the world which we cannot ennoble by our
method of performing it and by the spirit in
which we undertake it. The ideal life which
presents us with the spectacle of the Master
washing the feet of his disciples and kneading
the common clay of the ground, teaches us how
to invest with dignity the meanest labour of
our hands. From the examples of Chaucer,
whose pen ‘moved over bills of lading,’ and of
Burns, whose feet trod deep into the miry
furrows behind the plough he guided, we may
learn that while a humble toil cannot degrade
the man, a man may infinitely ennoble the toil.
Let us but once recognise that it is necessary
and right that any piece of work should be
done, and that it has fallen to our lot to do it,
and a genuine pleasure may be derived from its
thorough performance. ‘The manly part,’ says
Emerson, ‘is to do with might and main what
you can do.’ Indifference as to the excellence
of the work turned out, hurried or perfunctory
or slovenly execution, will result in lethargy and
self-dissatisfaction; while a right pride in a
piece of good work well done will leave the
nerves braced and not relaxed, and the faculties
developed instead of diminished.</p>

<p>Fortunate, again, beyond the power of mishap
to depress, is the man who is endowed with such
elasticity of spirit that he can shake off the
anxieties and wearinesses of the mind in the
mere delight of existence; to whom the fresh
breath of morning as he rises, the sense of bodily
strength as he steps forth into the open air, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">{287}</span>
consciousness of vigour as he performs his mid-day
toil, the assurance of sound sleep as he lays
his head on the pillow at night, can bring
oblivion of the losses or the disappointments of
yesterday. And, once more, a measure of this
good fortune is within the reach of most of us.
The temper that broods over trouble, that cries
over spilt milk, and forebodes unrealised ills, is
one easy indeed to yield to, but one which can
be put to rout with a little fortitude and resolve;
and, that once achieved, the energies necessary
for the retrieval of our position will quickly
reassert themselves.</p>

<p>Highly favoured, too, of fortune is the man
who has been born with an ear and a heart for
Music, with an eye and a heart for Art and
Nature, and with a brain and a heart for Poetry;
for veritably in these are to be found the most
inexhaustible riches, the most enduring delights,
the most exalting pleasures. But it would be
unavailing to attempt to capitulate the various
gifts that birth or accident confers which are
worthy to be regarded as good fortune. A
moment’s reflection is all that is needed to prove
that opulence is but a small and single item
among the infinite number of such gifts; and
the sordid tendency of the mind, and the liability
of words to become restricted in their meaning
and debased in their application, is evinced in
the narrowed signification of opulence ascribed by
common usage to the word ‘fortune.’ We live
in a money-grasping age, and it is well to call
to mind from time to time that guineas are not
the only counters with which the game of life
is played and won or lost, and that our banker
is not, after all, the best judge of our fortune.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_IVORY_TRADE">THE IVORY TRADE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no doubt in the world but that American
trade is being admirably served by American
consuls in every part of the world. The Reports
which these gentlemen send are not only written
in an interesting manner, but embrace nearly
every subject that can be of service to the
industrial occupations of any country. Among
recent Reports is one by Mr Consul Webster on
ivory so far as it relates to the Sheffield cutlery
trade; and as his Report embraces nearly every
matter connected with this trade—though some
of his figures are not very new—the facts cannot
fail to be of interest to this country also. From
the Report, it appears that in 1880 there were
imported 13,435 cwt. of ivory from the following
countries; British East Indies sent us 2972 cwt.;
west coast of Africa, 2310 cwt.; Egypt, 2003 cwt.;
British possessions in South Africa, 1114 cwt.;
the native states, east coast of Africa, 1099 cwt.;
Aden, 693 cwt.; France, 612 cwt.; Holland, 431
cwt.; Malta, 411 cwt.; Portuguese possessions,
West Africa, 361 cwt.; British possessions, West
Africa, 162 cwt.; and all other countries, 1267
cwt.</p>

<p>Malta is the port of shipment to England of
ivory that finds its way to Tripoli and other
points on the north coast of Africa. To Holland,
ivory is brought from her possessions on the
coast of Africa. France receives but little except
what has been purchased in England, portions
of which are sometimes returned. The Bombay,
Siam, and Zanzibar ivory is bought for the
making of piano keys, carvings, and other expensive
articles of luxury. All ivory from the east
coast of Africa, except the Cape, comes through
Zanzibar, and pays a royalty to the sultan. This
is known to the trade by a mark—a rude figure
of an elephant—that is put upon it after the
payment of this royalty. Mr Webster calls attention
to the fact that this mark is often erased
from tusks that are to be sent to the United
States from the English sales, and suggests that
this is done to prevent identification, and evade
the extra duty chargeable on all ‘goods the produce
of countries east of the Cape of Good Hope,
when imported from places west of the Cape of
Good Hope.’ It will be news to most of us
in this country that the United States thus tries
to prohibit, where possible, the purchase of raw
material through the European markets.</p>

<p>Mammoth tusks of ivory occasionally come
to this country from Siberia; but as these have
been lying exposed for centuries, and probably
for many thousands of years, and often buried
in ice, the ‘nature’ has gone out of them, and
they are not fit for the cutler’s use. The teeth
of the walrus and hippopotamus are used in
considerable quantity, and being of suitable size,
are used whole for making expensive carved
handles. Ivory of the best quality comes from
the west coast of Africa, under the names of
Cameroon, Angola, and Gaboon ivory. This is
brought down from the interior, and retains a
larger proportion of the ‘fat’ or gelatine, from
the fact, probably, that it is more recently from
the animal. In this state it is called ‘green’
ivory. It is more translucent, and not so white
as the Egyptian and other kinds, called ‘white’
ivory, that have been lying a longer time and in
a more sandy region, and exposed to the heat
of the sun until the animal matter has disappeared.
The excellence of the ‘green’ ivory consists
in its greater toughness and in its growing
whiter by age, instead of yellow, as is the case
with the whiter varieties. Yet buyers of cutlery,
through ignorance of these qualities, usually
prefer the whiter kinds, which on that account are
more in demand for the Sheffield trade, and have
more than doubled in price since 1879. The
sales of ivory occur every three months at
London and Liverpool, and sales are also held
to a limited extent and at irregular intervals at
Rotterdam. At Liverpool, only ivory of the best
quality, and from the west coast of Africa, is
offered. Buyers from Germany and France and
agents of American consumers attend these sales;
and it is estimated that about one quarter of
the whole amount goes to Sheffield, another
quarter to London, and the other half to Germany,
France, and the United States.</p>

<p>Turning from the sources and sale of ivory,
we next have some very interesting facts relating
to its manufacture. The experienced eye is quick
to discern the value of a lot of ivory, when—which
is essential—it is guided by a knowledge
of the country from which it comes. It is also
said that the electric light is beginning to be
used to test the soundness of the tusks. There
is just now great anxiety as to the future supply
of ivory. The stocks in public warehouses are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">{288}</span>
smaller than for many years past, and the rapid
increase in prices is causing great anxiety to
manufacturers. At a recent sale at Liverpool,
the best African ivory sold by the ton at over
twelve shillings and sixpence per pound. This
will explain the fact that the principal factor
in the value of the best table cutlery is the
handle. When the ivory comes into the hands
of the cutler, much skill is required to make
the most of the precious material, and every
scrap is turned to account. After cutting out
the scales of all sizes for pocket-knives, and the
solid handles for table cutlery, the small pieces
are usually sold to the button-makers, or maybe
made into ‘pearls.’ These latter are the small
pieces of ivory, pearl, or horn inserted into the
handles of tea and coffee pots as non-conductors
of heat, and are so called because they were
originally made of pearl. The fine sawdust is
sold for fertilising purposes, for the manufacture
of gelatine, and for making a fine white sizing
used in the manufacture of lace curtains and other
fabrics. The refuse still remaining goes to the
makers of ivory black. The proportion of this
residuum is about fifteen pounds to the hundredweight,
and sells at from sixteen to twenty pounds
per ton. Many efforts have been made to devise
some method for the solidification of ivory dust,
but as yet without success. Great skill is required
in the cutting of ivory, as of wood, to bring out
the beauty of the grain. The saw of the cutter
occasionally reveals a rifle-ball that has been
lodged in the tusk, and that has been completely
covered over by subsequent growth. About one-third
the length of the tusk, where it enters the
head of the elephant, is hollow. This hollow,
when the tusk is in place upon the live animal,
is filled with a soft pulp or core, which supplies
the growth of the tusk. A ball lodged in this
core will in time be imbedded in the solid ivory.
This hollow portion is cut off and sold separately,
except the thinnest portion, as bangle
ivory, and is in great demand for bangles or
ornamental rings for the ankles and arms of
Indian and African women. That portion of
the tusk towards the point is usually more solid
and of finer grain. This is cut off and sold by
itself at high prices under the name of billiard-ball
points. Small teeth of from ten to fifteen
pounds-weight are called in the trade ‘scrivelloes.’
The points of these small tusks are used in their
natural state for making handles for expensive
carving sets and for other articles of luxury.
The large proportion of very small tusks which
are now brought to market annually is a sure
indication of the increasing number of elephants
that die young. To show to what size these
tusks might attain, the American consul states
that there was in a Sheffield showroom an
African elephant’s tusk nine feet long, twenty-one
inches in girth, and weighing one hundred
and sixty pounds. The value of the tusk was
one hundred and thirty pounds, and it is said
that an animal large enough and strong enough
to carry such a pair would attract far more attention
than Jumbo did. In the nine years which
ended with 1881, there were 5286 tons of ivory
imported into Great Britain, and as the number
of tusks is known, the average weight of pairs
of tusks can be ascertained. It is a little under
forty pounds each pair. At this rate, these imports
represent 296,016 pairs, and consequently the same
number of elephants have either died long ago,
or have been recently slaughtered, to supply the
demands of luxury in nine years alone. ‘At
this rate of destruction,’ says Mr Webster, ‘it
will be seen how rapidly this noble animal must
disappear, and how surely ivory will become a
thing of the past. There are, doubtless, large
quantities of ivory still remaining in the interior
of the African continent; but with the rapid
advance of civilised man, and the temptation
of increasing high prices, these will soon be discovered
and exhausted.’</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
